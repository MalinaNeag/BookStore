## Overview

Our Bookstore Application has two user roles: the client and the bookstore manager. Both roles require a unique username and a password to access the system. Clients can view the list of available genres and select one to see all the books available in that genre. Once they have selected a book, they can view its details such as synopsis, author bio, and blurbs. They can add the book to their cart and proceed to checkout. During checkout, they will be asked to provide their full name, address, and phone number. After completing their purchase, they can view a list of their past orders, including their order status (pending, shipped, or delivered).

The bookstore manager, on the other hand, can access their account and add or delete items from the inventory. Each book should have a title, author, publisher, price, and optionally a picture. Furthermore, upon logging in, the bookstore manager can see the list of pending orders. From this list, they can choose to process new orders and set the status of the order accordingly.
